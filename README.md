This will provide access to past and current NY Times best seller lists


NY TIMES BOOKS API PRACTICE

This API provides a list of books that are currently on the NY Times best-seller list. In this example, the parameter "current" is used to show the latest list. However, a specific list date may be found by formatting the date to "YYYY-MM-DD". 

In this example, the parameter "paperback-nonfiction" is used to show that specific list. Another example of a list could be "hardcover-fiction". To find other examples of lists to search for, use the following - 'https://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3/lists/names.json?api-key=INSERT_API_KEY' 

The final parameter that must be entered in order for this API to work is an API-KEY.
